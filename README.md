# ðŸŽµ Music Personality Analyzer

I have a diverse Spotify playlist with over 400 songs, covering multiple languages, genres, time periods, and completely different artists. This made me wonderâ€”if someone listened to my playlist, would they be able to understand anything about my personality?  

To explore this, I exported my favorite Spotify playlist as a `.csv` file using **Exportify** and imported it into Google Sheets. Out of the 20 available columns, only three remained: **Track Name, Album Name, and Artist Name(s)**. Despite this limited data, I was surprised by how many insights ChatGPT could generate about me based solely on my album collection.  

Thatâ€™s when I had an ideaâ€”to build a tool that automates this process, allowing anyone to gain unique insights into their music taste and personality.  

## ðŸš€ How It Works  

When you export your Spotify playlist, the AI analyzes **10 key attributes** for each track - far more than what I manually processed:  

- **Track Name**  
- **Album Name**  
- **Artist Name(s)**  
- **Genre(s)**  
- **Danceability**  
- **Energy**  
- **Speechiness**  
- **Liveness**  
- **Valence**  
- **Tempo**  

## ðŸ”’ Privacy & Open-Source  

I **do not store or collect any user data**. This is a **personal, open-source project** deployed using **GitHub Pages**.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or customize it for your own use.
